The base rule template contains common elements that can be reused by other rules. This building block does not produce
any validation items.

`id` can be used to declare an identifier for the rule. The use of URIs is supported (and encouraged) here.

A label or title can be provided with the `title` property, and a description or definition with `description`.

The actual error message that will be returned by the validator can be customized through the `message` property.
